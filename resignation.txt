Dear HR department,

I am writing this letter to formally submit my resignation from my position as a Web Developer at P&P Infotech Applying Solutions. My last day of employment will bedate, January 30, 2023.

I have thoroughly enjoyed my time working at P&P Infotech Applying Solutions and appreciate the opportunities for professional and personal development that the company has provided me. I have learned a great deal during my tenure and have had the privilege of working with a talented and supportive team.

After careful consideration, I have decided to pursue a new direction in my career that aligns more closely with my long-term goals and aspirations. This decision was not made lightly, and I am grateful for the experiences and knowledge gained during my time at P&P Infotech Applying Solutions.

I am committed to ensuring a smooth transition and am more than willing to assist in training a replacement or providing any necessary documentation to facilitate the handover process. I would like to express my gratitude to the entire team for their guidance, mentorship, and camaraderie throughout my tenure.

I appreciate the opportunities for professional and personal development that you and the company have provided me during my time here. I look forward to maintaining a positive relationship with P&P Infotech Applying Solutions and my colleagues even after my departure.

Thank you once again for the support and opportunities. I wish the company continued success in all its future endeavors.
