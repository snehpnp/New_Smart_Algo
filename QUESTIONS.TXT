// // 1. What is the difference between null and undefined in JavaScript?
// Answer : In JavaScript, undefined means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. On the other hand, null is an assignment value. It can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value. Also, undefined and null are two distinct types: undefined is a type itself (undefined) while null is an object.

// // 2. What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript?
// Answer : The == operator checks equality only, whereas === checks equality and data type. For example, 5 == "5" is true because JavaScript performs type coercion, converting the string to a number. However, 5 === "5" is false because the types are different.

// // 3. What is a closure in JavaScript?
// Answer : A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function’s scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

// // 4. What is a promise in JavaScript?
// Answer : A promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. It allows you to write asynchronous code in a more synchronous fashion, avoiding the “callback hell” that can occur in JavaScript.

// // 5. What is a callback function in JavaScript?
// Answer : A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.

// // 6. What is a higher-order function in JavaScript?
// Answer : A higher-order function is a function that takes another function as an argument or returns a function as a result. This allows for the creation of more dynamic functions that can modify and extend the behavior of other functions.

// // 7. What is a pure function in JavaScript?
// Answer : A pure function is a function where the return value is determined only by its input values, without observable side effects. This is in contrast to impure functions that can have side effects and produce different results for the same input.

// // 8. What is the event loop in JavaScript?
// Answer : The event loop is the process that allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations, despite the fact that JavaScript is single-threaded. It is the mechanism that allows the runtime to work asynchronously and handle multiple requests coming in without blocking.

// // 9. What is the difference between let and var in JavaScript?
// Answer : The main difference between let and var is that let is block-scoped, while var is function-scoped. This means that a variable declared with let is only available inside the block it was declared in, while a variable declared with var is available throughout the function it was declared in.

// // 10. What is the difference between const and let in JavaScript?
// Answer : The difference between const and let is that const is used to declare variables that cannot be reassigned, while let is used to declare variables that can be reassigned. However, both const and let are block-scoped.

// // 1. What is the difference between Node.js and JavaScript?
// Answer : Node.js is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside a web browser, while JavaScript is a programming language used to create interactive effects within web browsers.

// Explain Long Answer : Node.js is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside a web browser, while JavaScript is a programming language used to create interactive effects within web browsers. Node.js allows developers to use JavaScript to write server-side code, enabling them to build scalable and high-performance applications. JavaScript, on the other hand, is primarily used for client-side scripting in web browsers to create dynamic and interactive web pages. While both Node.js and JavaScript share the same syntax and core features, they are used in different contexts and environments.



// // 2. What is the event loop in Node.js?
// Answer : The event loop is the mechanism that allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations, despite the fact that JavaScript is single-threaded. It is the process that handles asynchronous operations and ensures that the server can respond to multiple requests without blocking.

// Explain Long Answer : The event loop is the mechanism that allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations, despite the fact that JavaScript is single-threaded. It is the process that handles asynchronous operations and ensures that the server can respond to multiple requests without blocking. When a request is made to the server, Node.js processes it asynchronously and continues to handle other requests while waiting for the response. This allows Node.js to handle high levels of concurrency and perform efficiently. The event loop is responsible for managing the execution of asynchronous tasks, callbacks, and events in Node.js, ensuring that the server remains responsive and performs well under heavy loads.


// // 3. What is the difference between require and import in Node.js?
